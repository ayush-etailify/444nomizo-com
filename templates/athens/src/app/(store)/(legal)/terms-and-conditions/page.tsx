          Shipping Address – User’s shipping address and pin code will be
          verified with the database of Etailify before User proceeds to pay for
          its purchase. In the event the order is not serviceable by Etailify’s
          logistics service providers, or the area is not covered, Etailify will
          request the User to provide an alternate shipping address. The User
          must ensure the payment and shipping address is within India. The User
          shall be responsible for accepting and collecting the package from the
          alternative address, once the said alternative address has been
          submitted by the User. Confirmation from the logistics service
          provider of successful delivery to the alternative shipping address is
          deemed as acceptance of delivery by the User and Etailify will have no
          liability in this regard.
        </p>

        <p>

          purchase/order of the product(s) along with an official identity proof

          from the date of the Order Confirmation.

          provided by the User.
        </p>

          issues, natural calamities, disruption in the supply chains,

          If you choose the option to save your card, you shall expressly
          authorize us to process the indicated details to be used as necessary

          subsequently stored or processed as part of the payment details.
          Consenting to the activation of this functionality means that your
          data will automatically appear in these fields when making future
          purchases, so you will not have to enter your details again for each

          section. The use of this function may require you to change your
          access password for security reasons. Remember that security when

        <h3>SECURITY AND USER RESTRICTION</h3>

        <p>
          Etailify implements standard measures to protect against unauthorized
          access to and unlawful interception of the Personal Data. However, no
          internet site can fully eliminate security risks. Etailify endeavors

          security measures on the Website. Etailify may use such software as it
          determines is best for maintaining security. However, the internet is
          not absolutely a secure environment, and the Website cannot ensure or

          through the Website. Etailify has the right to disable the
